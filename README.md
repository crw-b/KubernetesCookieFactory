# Kubernetes Cookie Factory
This repo contains instructions to recreate a demo provided alongside the [Welcome to the Cookie Factory! An Illustrated Intro to Kubernetes](./Slides/SCaLE20x_Intro_to_Containers_K8s_GKE.pdf) talk, which was given as [part of the Southern California Linux Expo in 2023](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x/presentations/welcome-cookie-factory-illustrated-intro-kubernetes). You can find a more in-depth overview of the content from that presentation in [this blog post by Kaslin Fields](https://kaslin.rocks/intro-to-kubernetes-containers-at-scale/).

The demo found in this repo is based off of the [Learn Kubernetes Basics Interactive](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) tutorial provided by Kubernetes. However, this repo is meant to be cloned and run on your local machine and uses [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).
